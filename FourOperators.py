# operators

# Arithmetic operators---- +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a+b)

# Assignment operators---- =, +=, -=
# c = 15
# c += 3
# print(c)

# Comparison operators---- ==, !=, <=, >=, <, >
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)
# print(a <= b)
# print(a >= b)
# print(a < b)
# print(a > b)

# Logical operators---- and, or, not
# a = 15
# b = 20
# print(not a == 15)
# print(a == b or a != b)
# print(a == b and b == 15)

# Membership operators---- in, not in
# This operator check and return true/false
# string1 = 'Hello'
# print('H' in string1)
# l = [10, 20, 30, 50, 40]
# print(500 not in l)

# Identity operators---- is, is not
# As like same as a comparison operator
# x = 10
# y = 100
# print(x is y, x == y)
# print(x is not y, x != y)

# Bitwise operators---- &, |, ^
# x = 10
# y = 8
# print(bin(x))
# print(bin(y))
# print(bin(x & y), x & y)
# print(bin(x | y), x | y)
# print(bin(x ^ y), x ^ y)
